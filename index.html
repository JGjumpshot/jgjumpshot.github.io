        <p class="haiku">
            <i>I wake up at dawn <br>
            the knowledge of nations in hand <br>
            to begin working <br></i><br>
            <span>
                This poem was inspired by previous and current work as a developer.

        <h2>My personal interests</h2>
        <p>
            One of my personal hobbies is collecting Legos, more specifically Star Wars legos.<br> I love collecting all the different types of vehicles portrayed in the films. <br>Most recently I acquired the Slave I from Empire strikes back. <br>This build was cool because it's in one of my favorite movies and gives me a good building challenge. <br>It definitely took me 4 days to figure it out.
        </p>
        <img width="400px" src="./images/slaveI.jpg"><br>
        <p>Some outdoor activies i enjoy include basketball and longboarding. <br>I longboard mostly around my home in American Fork, but enjoy going into some of Utah's beautiful canyons.<br> Basketball has been a big part of my growing up years mainly because of my height. <br> I am 6'4" and love to play Post in basketball; muscling through rebounds and posting up in the paint</p>
        <p>
            Finally I love playing video games!<br>
            <ul>
                Some of my favorite games include:
                <li>Overwatch</li>
                <li>Fortnite</li>
                <li>Star Wars Battlefront II</li>
                <li>Destiny 2</li>
            </ul>
            Shooter games that don't depict too much violence and gore are generally my go to. <br>
            I like some of the missions in Star Wars and Destiny with the teamwork and strategem of Overwatch and Fortnite.
